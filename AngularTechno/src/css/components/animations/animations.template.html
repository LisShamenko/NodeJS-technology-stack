                <h4>Mrs. Featherstone</h4>
                <p>
                    She may be a bit frumpy, but Mrs Featherstone gets
                    the job done. She lays her largish cream-colored
                    eggs on a daily basis. She is gregarious to a fault.
                </p>
                <p>This Austra White is our most prolific producer.</p>

                <h4>Hen Solo</h4>
                <p>
                    Though the most recent addition to our flock, Hen
                    Solo is a fast favorite among our laying brood. She
                    is a sassy and suspicious hen; we frequently have to
                    follow her to find where she has hidden her loot from
                    the other hens.
                </p>
                <p>This Snowy Easter Egger lays in delicate shades of
                    blue and green. A full dozen of her eggs costs an
                    additional $2.</p>

                <h4>Cluck Norris</h4>
                <p>
                    Every brood has its brawler. Cluck Norris is our
                    feistiest hen, frequently picking fights with other
                    hens about laying territory and foraging space. Her
                    sister hens continue to hope that she will follow the
                    steps of her namesake (eventually) and focus the her
                    strength of will for good.
                </p>
                <p>This Buff Chantecler is as robust and hardy as her
                    Canadian forebears, laying through the coldest parts
                    of the winter.</p>

                <h4>Peggy Schuyler</h4>
                <p>
                    Peggy was our first and friendliest hen. She is the
                    most likely to greet visitors to the yard, and
                    frequently to be found nesting in the coop. Though
                    not a prolific layer, her output is consistent and
                    regular. You will regularly find her eggs among your
                    dozen.
                </p>
                <p>This Lavender Orpington lays light brown eggs.</p>
